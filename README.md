## Project Medusa 

For the most part this is simply me trying to see exactly how this works. For now Later it'll be all fancy but like, for now. Let's just list the sections I intend to add

### [Python](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Python)

This should end up being where I keep my notes and some code regarding python. There's a fucktonne I don't know and I hope to make that fucktonne an fuckgram, or perhaps even a fuckmiligram. 

### [Java](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Java)

**Pending**  
As said just languages. 


### [C](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/C)
**Pending**  
Literally just because my darling dearest needs to learn this language so I figured so should I. 

### [Data Structures](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Data_Structures)
**Pending**  
Mostly going to be questions and stuff from Hackerrank, maybe with some notes from a couple of books

### [Interesting Algorithms](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Interesting_Algorithms)
**Pending**  
This should be a combination of ["interview algorithms"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/) and general famous algorithm problems

### [WeThinkCode](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/WeThinkCode)
**Pending**  
My Lovely sent me a bunch of their problems so I kinda wanna screw around with it

### [Project Euler](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Project_Euler)
**Pending**  
Cause it's scary and why not

### [Distributive Systems](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Distributive_Systems)
**Pending**  
So these are supposed to be questions from hackerrank but I'm thinking I should add notes from textbooks too. Just like networking. Or lets make that another section

### [Networking](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/Networking)
**Pending**  
Notes, as said before

### [AI](https://ravenayn.github.io/Project-Medusa/AI)
**Pending**  
So this is going to have to be mostly theory but hackkerrank has some questions that are interesting so.
