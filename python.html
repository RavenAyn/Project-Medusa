 I'll get here in a second I just have womanly things to take care of real quick but just to check that this works;  </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">

    print [ [ i, j, k] for i in range( x + 1) for j in range( y + 1) for k in range(z+1) if ( ( i + j +k) != n )]

listcomp(x, y, z, n)

    peeps tend to name their things dramatically, and because of the story behind Medusa. The traditional telling goes along the lines of, she was this beautiful woman that Poseidon wanted to have sexy time with, but she was a priest of Artemis, famed for her chastity. So Poseidon did what them males do and he raped her on the altar to Artemis, and as a punishment Artemis turned her into a gorgon so any man who looks at her turns to stone. This version of the story is a result of a slightly fucked up translation. The name Medusa means gaurdian and protector. After being raped, Artemis gave Medusa the snakes and the power to turn menfamed for her chastity.

After being raped, Artemis gave Medusa the snakes and the power to turn men to stone as protection, not as punishment. It's a transformation story, and as Medusa's power to protect her against the evils of the world was her face, so is mine the things I will learn here. That all being said this page is silly, only for myself, I know I'm new and bad at stuff, but I'm learning, and here are my notes and stuff.    peeps tend to name their things dramatically, and because of the story behind Medusa.
